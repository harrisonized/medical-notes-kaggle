       "  'FINDINGS': 'Examination was performed on 9/1/05. There is marked supraspinatus tendinosis and extensive tearing of the substance of the tendon and articular surface, extending into the myotendinous junction as well. There is still a small rim of tendon along the bursal surface, although there may be a small tear at the level of the rotator interval. There is no retracted tendon or muscular atrophy (series #6 images #6-17). Normal infraspinatus tendon. There is subscapularis tendinosis with fraying and partial tearing of the superior most fibers extending to the level of the rotator interval (series #9 images #8-13; series #3 images #8-14). There is no complete tear, gap or fiber retraction and there is no muscular atrophy. There is tendinosis and superficial tearing of the long biceps tendon within the bicipital groove, and there is high grade (near complete) partial tearing of the intracapsular portion of the tendon. The biceps anchor is intact. There are degenerative changes in the greater tuberosity of the humerus but there is no fracture or subluxation. There is degeneration of the superior labrum and there is a small nondisplaced tear in the posterior superior labrum at the one to two o�clock position (series #6 images #12-14; series #3 images #8-10; series #9 images #5-8). There is a small sublabral foramen at the eleven o�clock position (series #9 image #6). There is no osseous Bankart lesion. Normal superior, middle and inferior glenohumeral ligaments. There is hypertrophic osteoarthropathy of the acromioclavicular joint with narrowing of the subacromial space and flattening of the superior surface of the supraspinatus musculotendinous junction, which in the appropriate clinical setting is an MRI manifestation of an impinging lesion (series #8 images #3-12). Normal coracoacromial, coracohumeral and coracoclavicular ligaments. There is minimal fluid within the glenohumeral joint. There is no atrophy of the deltoid muscle.',\n",

By blunt and sharp dissection, it was dissected out from underneath the extensor tendons and the stalk appeared to arise from the distal radiocapitellar joint and the dorsal capsule was excised along with the ganglion and the specimen was removed and submitted.  The small superficial vessels were electrocoagulated and instilled after closing the skin with 4-0 Prolene, into the area was approximately 6 to 7 mL of 0.25 Marcaine with epinephrine.  A Jackson-Pratt drain was inserted and then after the tourniquet was released, it was kept deflated until at least 5 to 10 minutes had passed and then it was activated and then removed in the recovery room.  The dressings applied to the hand were that of Xeroform, 4x4s, ABD, Kerlix, and elastic wrap over a volar fiberglass splint.  The tourniquet was released.  Circulation returned to the fingers.

There is not significant diarrhea, just some lower stools.  No significant pain.  Therefore, it is possible that we are just dealing with a hemorrhoidal bleed, therefore, colonoscopy now needed.  Past history reviewed.  Specifics of workup, need for followup, and similar discussed.  All questions answered. A normal digital rectal examination was performed.  The PCF-160 AL was inserted into the anus and advanced to the cecum without difficulty, as identified by the ileocecal valve, cecal stump, and appendical orifice.  All mucosal aspects thoroughly inspected, including a retroflexed examination.  Withdrawal time was greater than six minutes.  Unfortunately, the terminal ileum could not be intubated despite multiple attempts. Findings were those of a normal cecum, right colon, transverse colon, descending colon.  A small cecal polyp was noted, this was biopsy-removed, placed in bottle #1.  Random biopsies from the cecum obtained, bottle #2; random biopsies from the transverse colon obtained, as well as descending colon obtained, bottle #3.  There was an area of inflammation in the proximal sigmoid colon, which was biopsied, placed in bottle #4.  There was an area of relative sparing, with normal sigmoid lining, placed in bottle #5, randomly biopsied, and then inflammation again in the distal sigmoid colon and rectum biopsied, bottle #6, suggesting that we may be dealing with Crohn disease, given the relative sparing of the sigmoid colon and junk lesion.

This was felt consistent with vasculitis. She began q2month cycles of Cytoxan (1,575mg IV on 2/29/96. She became pregnant after her 4th cycle of Cytoxan, despite warnings to the contrary. After extensive discussions with OB/GYN it was recommended she abort the pregnancy. She underwent neuropsychologic testing which revealed no significant cognitive deficits. She later agreed to the abortion. She has undergone 9 cycles of Cytoxan ( one cycle every 2 months) as of 4/97. She had complained of one episode of paresthesias of the LUE in 1/97. MRI then showed no new signs ischemia.',\n",

       "  'CLINICAL HISTORY': 'This is a 41-year-old male patient who comes in with chest pain, had had a previous MI in 07/2003 and stents placement in 2003, who comes in for a stress myocardial perfusion scan. With the patient at rest, 10.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi was injected and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained.',\n",
       "  'PROCEDURE AND INTERPRETATION': 'The patient exercised for a total of 12 minutes on the standard Bruce protocol.  The peak workload was 12.8 METS.  The resting heart rate was 57 beats per minute and the peak heart rate was 123 beats per minute, which was 69% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate response.  The blood pressure response was normal with a resting blood pressure of 130/100 and a peak blood pressure of 158/90.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and leg pain.  EKG at rest showed normal sinus rhythm.  The peak stress EKG did not reveal any ischemic ST-T wave abnormalities.  There was ventricular bigeminy seen during exercise, but no sustained tachycardia was seen.  At peak, there was no chest pain noted.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and left pain.  At peak stress, the patient was injected with 30.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained, and was compared to resting myocardial perfusion imaging.',\n",
       "  'MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING': '1.  The overall quality of the scan was good. 2.  There was no diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging. 3.  The left ventricular cavity appeared normal in size. 4.  Gated SPECT images revealed mild septal hypokinesis and mild apical hypokinesis.  Overall left ventricular systolic function was low normal with calculated ejection fraction of 46% at rest.',\n",
       "  'CONCLUSIONS': '1.  Good exercise tolerance. 2.  Less than adequate cardiac stress.  The patient was on beta-blocker therapy. 3.  No EKG evidence of stress induced ischemia. 4.  No chest pain with stress. 5.  Mild ventricular bigeminy with exercise. 6.  No diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging. 7.  Gated SPECT images revealed septal and apical hypokinesis with overall low normal left ventricular systolic function with calculated ejection fraction of 46% at rest.',\n",
